# FIFA-Data-Cleaning-and-EDA

This repository contains scripts and resources for cleaning FIFA data, specifically data related to football players and teams. The purpose of this project is to provide a clean and consistent dataset that can be used for various data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Introduction
FIFA is a popular video game series that includes a vast amount of data about football players and teams. However, the data provided by the game may not always be clean or structured in a way that is suitable for analysis. This project aims to address these issues by providing a set of scripts and resources for cleaning FIFA data.

## Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process involves several steps to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analysis. The following steps are typically followed:

Data Loading: The raw data files are loaded into the cleaning script or tool.
Data Inspection: An initial inspection of the data is performed to identify any obvious inconsistencies or issues.
Missing Data Handling: Missing values are identified and handled appropriately, either through imputation or removal.
Data Transformation: The data is transformed into a standardized format to ensure consistency and ease of analysis. This may include renaming columns, converting data types, or aggregating data.
Data Validation: The cleaned data is validated against predefined rules or criteria to ensure its quality and integrity.
Data Export: The cleaned data is exported to a suitable file format, such as CSV or JSON, for further analysis or use.
The specific steps and techniques used in the cleaning process may vary depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.

## Requirements
To use the scripts and resources in this repository, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
Pandas library
Ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the cleaning scripts.
